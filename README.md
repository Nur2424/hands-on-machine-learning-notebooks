## Hands-On Machine Learning — Study Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of **Jupyter notebooks** created while studying and applying the concepts from the book:

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch** by Aurélien Géron

The goal of this repository is to combine **theoretical understanding** with **practical experimentation**, following the structure and philosophy of the book.

## What This Repository Contains

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a specific chapter or topic and includes:

- Clear explanations of key machine learning concepts
- Answers to end-of-chapter review questions
- Practical experiments using real datasets
- Careful discussion of trade-offs, limitations, and results
- Well-structured, reproducible code using scikit-learn

These notebooks are intended both as **personal study notes** and as a **public learning resource**.

## Example: Chapter 8 — Dimensionality Reduction

The Chapter 8 notebook covers:

- Motivations and drawbacks of dimensionality reduction
- The curse of dimensionality
- Linear methods such as PCA and its variants
- Nonlinear methods and manifold learning
- Evaluation strategies for dimensionality reduction
- A full practical experiment on the MNIST dataset:
  - Random Forest classification
  - Training time comparison
  - Accuracy evaluation
  - GridSearchCV and pipelines
  - Analysis of when dimensionality reduction helps and when it does not

This notebook demonstrates how theory from the book translates into real-world machine learning decisions.

## Purpose of This Project

The purpose of this repository is not just to implement algorithms, but to understand:
- **Why** a method works
- **When** it should be used
- **When** it should not be used
- **How** theoretical assumptions affect practical performance

This reflects the central message of *Hands-On Machine Learning*:  
**machine learning is about informed trade-offs, not blind application of techniques.**
